                I've been watching anime for a long time. Two of my favorite anime are Frieren and So I'm a Spider, So
                What? There's a lot of different anime across many genres.
                Most anime are adaptations of novels or manga. These mediums are considered to be part of the Japanese
                Pop-culture. They are generally divided in the four major demographics:
                Seinen (young men), Shounen (boys), Josei (young women), and Shoujo (girls). Shounen is often a lot of
                action while Shoujo is more towards romance. Seinen and Josei follows the
                same pattern, but are usually more diverse.
