                    It wasn't hard getting into Vue, but how the data should be emitted by the child component to the
                    parent
                    component was confusing in the beginning. I watched a <a class="underline text-blue-600"
                        href="https://youtu.be/Kt2E8nblvXU?si=1FHzbFhvjOXKjgeH">Tutorial</a> that went through the
                    basics,
                    then
                    I looked through the relevant documentation page to page. With effort, I managed to get an
                    understanding
                    of
                    the basics of Vue.

                    I started a Vue project as in the tutorial above by running npm create vue@latest.

                    It was really fun to make the BaseTableRow.vue component since doing this (edit/deletion mode,
                    different
                    buttons etc) in normal JavaScript is insane. It leaves out having to manually identify what actions
                    going to be done to what element by what buttons.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm sure to use Vue in future projects.
